Subject: NET: skip GRO for otherhost packets

For network drivers using napi_gro_receive, packets are run through GRO,
even when the destination MAC address does not match, and they're supposed
to be delivered to another host behind a different bridge port.

This can be very expensive, because for drivers without TSO or scatter-
gather, this can only be undone by copying the skb and checksumming it
again.

Fix this by leaving skbs with PACKET_OTHERHOST untouched.
