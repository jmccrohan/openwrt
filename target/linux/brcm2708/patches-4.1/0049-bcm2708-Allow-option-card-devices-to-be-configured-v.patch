Subject: [PATCH 049/203] bcm2708: Allow option card devices to be configured
 via DT

If the kernel is built with Device Tree support, and if a DT blob
is provided for the kernel at boot time, then the platform devices
for option cards are not created. This avoids both the need to
blacklist unwanted devices, and the need to update the board
support code with each new device.
