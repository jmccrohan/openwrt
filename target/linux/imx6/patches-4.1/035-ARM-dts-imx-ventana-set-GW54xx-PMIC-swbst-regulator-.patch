Subject: [PATCH 1/3] ARM: dts: imx: ventana: set GW54xx PMIC swbst regulator
 as always-on

The GW54xx PMIC swbst regulator is used for LVDS power, CANbus xceiver
and HDMI DDC and is enabled by the bootloader. Set the regulator to
always-on so that Linux doesn't turn it off thinking its not needed.
