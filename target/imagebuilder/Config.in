	  This is essentially a stripped-down version of the buildroot
	  with precompiled packages, kernel image and image building tools.
	  You can use it to generate custom images without compiling anything

	  By default, the ImageBuilder will use the online package repositories
	  to fetch additional .ipk archives. Enabling this option will cause
	  the ImageBuilder to embed all built packages locally instead.
